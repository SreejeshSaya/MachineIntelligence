## Designing Artificial Neural Networks for classification of LBW Cases from Scratch


### What's left!?
- [ ] Number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, number of iterations, learning rate
- [ ] Creating a layer class - (looks like there is no need)
- [ ] Choice of error and activation functions - later
- [x] regularization -- (L2 reg used)
- [x] initialisation of weights -- (He & Xavier init used)
- [ ] Batch vs Stochastic gradient descent vs MiniBatch Gradient descent
- [ ] RMS Prop/Adam optimization algo on mini batches - later
- [x] Normalization ()
